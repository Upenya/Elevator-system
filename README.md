# Elevator-system
We programmed a 3-floor elevator system using an ESP32 and Arduino IDE. Users can call the elevator from any floor using buttons. The ESP32 controls motor movement and floor logic. This project gave us practical experience in embedded systems, automation, and motor control for smart applications.
